# Custom agents template

This template repository makes it easy for enterprise and organization owners to get started with Copilot custom agents by providing:
* The basic file structure necessary for custom agents
* An example agent profile in the `agents` directory

> [!NOTE]
> The example agent profile is commented out, so you can use this template repository without unintentionally making a custom agent available to your team.

## Getting started

1. Using this template repository, create a private repository called `.github-private` in your organization.
1. Edit this README to best meet your needs. Consider including creation guidelines for custom agents or compliance considerations specific to your team.
1. Edit the provided `agents/example-agent.md` file to create your first custom agent. For more information, see [Creating custom agents](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-custom-agents).
